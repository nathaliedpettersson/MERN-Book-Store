## MERN-Book Store :bookmark:

#### Thanks to freeCodeCamp for guiding me with this project

- Includes MongoDB, Express, React and Node (MERN)
- Project also uses Tailwind CSS and I've added my own styling to this in order to practice using Tailwind
- Once project is deployed, I will also get a better understanding on how to deploy projects using a local backend folder with Vercel
